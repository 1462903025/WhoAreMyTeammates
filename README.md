# WhoAreMyTeammates
<h1>Intro</h1>
A plugin for SCP: SL that shows the SCP Team a list of their teammates on spawn.
Sends a broadcast out to the SCP Team (all players who are SCPs) at the beginning of the game with a customizable message including a list of SCP numbers who are ingame.

This plugin requires EXILED 2.11.1 
You can try other versions but do not blame me if it doesn't work :)
